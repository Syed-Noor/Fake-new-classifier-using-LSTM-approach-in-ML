According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import nltk\n","\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","import re\n","\n","\n","\n","df_fake = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Dataset/Fake.csv')\n","df_fake.head()\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yfja_n59u9bB"},"outputs":[],"source":["# from google.colab import drive\n","# drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nAFT83vxYjuv"},"source":["Here we just need  Title,text and label and remove extra titiles"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"b8lCCdWxthgq","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716370795177,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":615,"user":{"displayName":"syed Noorulhuda","userId":"13441058361303775913"}},"outputId":"3ae42edb-e725-4b21-bc4d-5073f9312d2a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0   Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year’...   \n","1   Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian ...   \n","2   Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke...   \n","3   Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obama’s Name...   \n","4   Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump Dur...   \n","\n","                                                text label  \n","0  Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans ...

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["\n","df_fake=df_fake.drop(['subject','date'],axis=1)\n","\n","df_fake['label'] ='FAKE'\n","\n","df_fake.head()\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tXKaUpXDZJXR"},"source":["We are processing the true dataset and furthur merging with df_fake data frame for final dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6088,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716370808829,"user":{"displayName":"syed Noorulhuda","userId":"13441058361303775913"},"user_tz":-300},"id":"9hDHvUPv6HHJ","outputId":"e9dea279-fdba-47f5-e751-6cbefe63a4cf"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0  As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip t...   \n","1  U.S. military to accept transgender recruits o...   \n","2  Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Muell...   \n","3  FBI Russia probe helped by Australian diplomat...   \n","4  Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much mor...   \n","\n","                                                text label  \n","0  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservat...

You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed. The soldier has better access to the Secretary of State than U.S. reporters do.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Join Patrick every week here at 21WIRE.TV for news, views and analysis on all top stories domestically and abroad THIS WEEK: Episode 4 The New World Order  Did Great Britain regain control of its former American colonies by stealth?

It s pretty sickening that she s even being asked to speak at a college commencement ANY college commencement! The Clinton GRIFTERS also owe the Haitian community answers on where money went after the Haiti earthquake relief effort.  The Haitian community is up in arms over much that happened after the 2010 earthquake. This should be interesting:Here is how the Clinton s used the money that Americans donated to help the devastated residents of Haiti to enrich themselves:On June 8, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to serve as the Class of 2017 commencement speaker at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York, where she will also be awarded an honorary degree. The announcement has incited protests from several members of the Haitian community who plan to protest the speech and are pushing the college s president, Rudy Crew, to rescind the invitation.PANDERING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE: Every time the Clintons get in a bind, they run to the black community to whitewash their tarnished image,  said Komokoda, the Haitian group protesting the speech, in a statement.  After Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath in the Monica Lewinsky affair, he brought in Jesse Jackson and a host of black preachers to lead prayers with him at the White House. To divert attention from her  deleted emails  debacle, Hillary had Bill DeBlasio s wife, Chirlane McCray, bring her to Brownsville, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Brooklyn, for a photo op with little black children. When newspaper editorials and cartoons were blasting her for her unending lies and demanding investigations and prosecutions, former New York City mayor David Dinkins brought her out for a keynote speech at his Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University. Today, for her resurrection from a shameful defeat by the last person most reasonable people felt could ever be president of the United States, the dirty work falls to Rudy Crew. HAITI RELIEF SCAM   QUESTIONS REMAIN:The Clintons  role in Haiti has incited immense criticism and has tarnished their relationship with the Haitian community. In 2010, Haiti suffered a massive earthquake. Several NGOs and the United Nations flocked to Haiti to help relief efforts, but their intervention came with several costs. In 2011, UN Peacekeepers caused a massive cholera outbreak that killed at least 9,500 people and sickened 800,000 others. During this time, Bill Clinton served as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While the Clinton Foundation has staunchly defended their role in Haiti, their involvement in the country has been far from successful.  Many of the most notable investments the Clintons helped launch, such as the new Marriott in the capital, have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with,  wrote Jonathan Katz for Politico in 2015.For Komokoda and many Haitians, the Clintons epitomize NGOs and corporations exploiting the crisis and relief efforts in Haiti for their own gain. Haitians also blame the Clintons for the controversial rule of former Haitian President Michel Martelly, who stepped down in February 2016 due to his record of corruption after the Clintons helped him get elected in 2010.MORE ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SCAM ON HAITI:Read more: Observer\",\n          \"LUCEDALE, Miss (Reuters) - Mississippi\\u2019s vast flatlands, laced with the remains of a fading industrial base, are fertile ground for the incendiary populism of Donald Trump. For the insurgent presidential candidate, there\\u2019s plenty of voter outrage to tap into here and in a swathe of other southern states that could push Trump closer to securing the Republican presidential nomination in the coming weeks. Mississippi\\u2019s unemployment rate is among the highest in the nation: more than 75,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared in the past 15 years; and white voters at the core of the state\\u2019s Republican Party fear the rise of immigrant workers. The deep economic dislocation felt by many in Mississippi, reflected in Reuters interviews with dozens of voters, explains how Trump is attracting broad-based support in southern states, including from many evangelical Christian voters prepared to overlook his past liberal positions on touchstone social issues. In South Carolina last weekend, exit polls showed Trump comfortably beat both his closest rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio among evangelical voters, despite their more consistent appeals to Christian values. \\u201cLook at immigration, look at terrorism, look at the things that really matter,\\u201d said Heather Fox, a field director for the Trump campaign in Mississippi. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t have a country, it\\u2019s not going to matter about the Bible or the Constitution because we are going to be dead and gone,\\u201d she added during a recent gathering of Republican voters in a Holiday Inn conference room in Lucedale, southern Mississippi, that began with a prayer.  Caleb Howell, a Baptist deacon, says even those with jobs often see little chance of promotion. \\u201cThere are not many options,\\u201d he said, \\u201ceven for preachers.\\u201d From the Mississippi coast through Alabama, Tennessee and the Appalachian coalfields of Kentucky, America\\u2019s economic recovery has been patchy if not outright elusive. The four-state region is the country\\u2019s least educated and least well paid, according to federal jobs data. Politically, the region has emerged as a bedrock of support for billionaire real estate mogul Trump, who has hammered home his pledge to return America to \\u201cwinning\\u201d ways versus foreign competitors and foes. In polling conducted for Reuters by Ipsos, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky ranked among Trump\\u2019s top seven states nationally, with more than 40 percent of Republicans and independent poll participants backing him. (See this graphic on census data from Trump's heartland. here) Alabama and Tennessee vote on March 1 on \\u201cSuper Tuesday\\u201d, along with 13 other states and territories in the heated race to select the Republican Party\\u2019s presidential candidate. Kentucky holds a Republican caucus on March 5 and Mississippians vote in their party primary on March 8. The 2007 to 2009 economic crisis fell particularly hard on Mississippi and neighboring states. The number of jobs fell faster than in much of the rest of the country, climbed back more slowly, and as of last year remained more than 200,000 short of where it was before the crisis, federal data show. Economic and cultural dislocation runs strong, whether it\\u2019s anger over Washington\\u2019s regulatory reach into industries like coal mining, the perceived threat to conservative values on issues like same-sex marriage, or the conviction that the economy no longer works for average Americans. A nation-leading 32 percent of the adult population in the four-state region has only a high school degree, a problem at a time when the fastest job and wage growth is in occupations that require a bachelor\\u2019s degree or more. Since 2000, jobs available in Mississippi for those with only a high school degree fell five percent, according to a Reuters analysis of federal occupational data. \\u00a0 Between 2000 and 2014, median household income fell nearly 12 percent in Mississippi, about twice as fast as the overall U.S. decline, adjusted for inflation. Income among white households fell slightly more than 12 percent, compared to a decline of less than five percent for all whites nationally. \\u201cWe\\u2019re shipping out all the work and bringing in all the people that don\\u2019t want to work,\\u201d said Walter Wright, 46, who owns a real-estate company in Hurley, Mississippi. He said he supports Trump because of his tough build-a-wall approach to stopping illegal immigration and because \\u201che is angry.\\u201d Although the region has the lowest share of foreign-born residents in the country, at fewer than four percent, and the lowest portion of Hispanic residents, whether born in the U.S. or elsewhere, the numbers have been growing. In Alabama and Mississippi, for instance, the Hispanic population more than doubled from 2000 to 2010. That\\u2019s coincided with a difficult economy. Mississippi, once a major builder of ships and furniture, has seen an exodus of thousands of jobs in both industries to China and Mexico over the past two decades. Mississippi\\u2019s manufacturers shed 75,738 jobs between 2000 and 2015, according to Manufacturers\\u2019 News Inc, a publisher and compiler of industrial directories and databases. \\u201cWe have had way too many industries shut down and now they are in Brazil, they are in Mexico, they are in China,\\u201d said Fox. Trump has said he will bring back American jobs \\u201cfrom China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.\\u201d  He has proposed doing this by slapping tariffs on foreign goods and negotiating better trade deals. He has threatened a 35 percent tax on Ford Motor Corp vehicles made in Mexico that are brought back to the United States to be sold. Most economists doubt Trump can revive manufacturing on its former scale in Mississippi or elsewhere, especially for unskilled workers. His threats also risk a trade war that could backfire by raising costs and hurting American jobs. While trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement may have shifted some jobs abroad, the integration of global supply chains has also helped Tennessee stand out in the region with its booming auto industry, and drawn foreign companies like Airbus to Mobile, Alabama. Republican Party officials say Trump has strong support, especially in northwest Alabama where International Paper Co shut a 43-year-old plant in 2014, laying off 1,100 workers. \\u201cThe day of putting on a suit and tie at 6 in the morning and getting a clean cut shave and taking your briefcase to an office somewhere, it\\u2019s gone,\\u201d said Blake Nash, 29, a Trump supporter whose mother was let go at the plant in 2006. In Nash\\u2019s town of Lexington, near the Tennessee border, red, white and blue Trump signs sprout from streets studded with Baptist churches, the only banners of any presidential candidate in the area.      Nash, who has no health insurance and calls his university degree in health sciences worthless, recently applied for a job with a company that contracts work with Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, but was rejected because he didn\\u2019t have the right training. With good jobs at home scarce, he works on contract in other states such as Texas.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0  Many farmers in Lauderdale County, the location of the International Paper plant, relied on the factory for their primary income, said Charlie Thompson, a farmer who worked there for 34 years and lost his job in 2014. Thompson, 58, former president of the Lauderdale County Farmers Federation, estimates that about 15\\u00a0percent of the sacked workers were farmers, further straining a county where the number of farms was already in decline. \\u201cIf you can equate signs in the yard with being popular, I would say probably Trump is a front runner around here,\\u201d said Thompson. Still, a win is no sure thing.\\u00a0 At the Lucedale forum, Chris McDaniel, a Republican state senator in Mississippi and Cruz supporter, hammered at Trump\\u2019s inconsistency on conservative hot-button issues such as abortion. \\u201cHow sure and solid has Trump been? Just a few years ago, he was pro-choice,\\u201d McDaniel said, referring to a television interview Trump gave in 1999 when he said \\u201cI\\u2019m very pro-choice\\u201d and that he would not ban partial-birth abortions.  He has since said he is against abortion. \\u201cWe are kind of afraid of what he has been in the past,\\u201d said Gussie Vise, 71, a retired teacher and wife of a local preacher. She is leaning toward Cruz but says of Trump,\\u201cwe like him.\\u201d\\u00a0 \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, already in legal limbo after an October court decision, could find its powers scaled back by President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican-led Congress, according to members of both political parties, lobbyists and lawyers.  That may mean the end of many of the agency\\u2019s rule-making actions that have enraged critics, including a proposal to stop companies from blocking customers from class action lawsuits and another one to limit payday lending. Creation of the CFPB was authorized in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law enacted in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis. The agency began operations in 2011. An agency to protect consumers\\u2019 finances was the idea of liberal Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Its creation is considered one of Democratic President Barack Obama\\u2019s top domestic policy achievements. A Trump administration is expected to be hostile to the agency as it is currently formulated. \\u201cThe election spells very bad news for the CFPB,\\u201d said Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group at law firm Ballard Spahr.  Many Republicans opposed the agency\\u2019s creation. They now say they dislike its structure and believe it oversteps its authority in enforcement. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very fragile thing. It was birthed in controversy and is under constant attack,\\u201d said consumer attorney Deepak Gupta, who worked at the CFPB in its early days. \\u201cIt may not survive the way we know it through this administration.\\u201d A single director leads both rule-making and enforcement, and can be dismissed only for cause. Furthermore, the agency is funded by the U.S. Federal Reserve system, which means it is not dependent on the typical congressional appropriations process. The Republican-led House of Representatives Financial Services Committee in September passed legislation without any Democratic votes that would change the name and structure of the agency and would create a five-member commission to govern it. Republicans also have pushed for the agency to receive funds from Congress to make it accountable to elected leaders. Both of those proposals would greatly weaken the power of Richard Cordray, the agency\\u2019s original and current director. Obama has blocked these Republican efforts with veto threats. Trump, though he has not directly addressed the CFPB, has said he wants to roll back parts of Dodd-Frank. Trump could, if he wanted to, fire Cordray on the first day of his presidency, especially following an October ruling by a three-judge federal appeals court panel that found the agency\\u2019s structure unconstitutional and that the president should be able to dismiss the director at will. That ruling was put on hold while the CFPB decides whether to petition the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for a review or appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. The agency has until Nov. 25 to decide. Trump\\u2019s administration could withdraw any appeal, letting the decision stand. Cordray, appointed in 2013, is halfway through his five-year term. Few in the banking industry think the entire agency will be eliminated. Democrats who support the agency will have a large presence in the Senate. Warren, who was Obama\\u2019s first choice to head the agency, has promised that Democrats will fight efforts to defang it. Even some bankers want to see it stay. Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said his group would fight to maintain the CFPB in some form because it consolidates consumer banking rules under one regulator.  Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Cordray could be replaced early in 2017, said Mark Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. Trump\\u2019s transition team is already looking into Cordray replacements, he said. The law allows for the president to terminate a director over inefficiency, malfeasance or neglect of duty, which leaves room for Trump to find cause regardless of what the appeals court decides, Calabria added. Cordray has set precedent with enforcement cases that Calabria and other critics have called backdoor rule-making.  \\u201cCordray has left the CFPB vulnerable to what his successor may want done because he didn\\u2019t hardwire rule-making,\\u201d Calabria said. If Cordray quits or is removed, statute calls for his deputy to step into the job temporarily. Acting Deputy Director David Silberman, also a strong consumer advocate, would likely continue to carry out the current agenda, said Quyen Truong, a partner at Washington law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. Truong was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until earlier this year. The CFPB did not respond to requests for comment on Cordray\\u2019s possible departure or the fate of current rule-making actions.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"TRUE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}],"source":["df=df.reindex(np.random.permutation(df.index))\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aL8afnxyaZn5"},"source":["For regular expression"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":493},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2690,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716370819936,"user":{"displayName":"syed Noorulhuda","userId":"13441058361303775913"},"user_tz":-300},"id":"nunObabl8r_j","outputId":"12b2d2bb-d264-4fbf-8727-f4ba5ee9945a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   title  \\\n","7878   Trump may have stopped the bleeding, but not t...   \n","15080  Yemen says Saudi-led coalition to allow commer...   \n","5300   Pence, Bannon appeal for conservatives to unit...   \n","6946   Trump moves to quickly fill his top Cabinet ranks   \n","15318  Pentagon confirms rare, three aircraft carrier...   \n","...                                                  ...   \n","12006  Egypt security forces kill five suspected mili...   \n","19213  U.S.-backed forces capture big gas field in Sy...   \n","18943  Pakistan finance minister denies corruption ch...   \n","1391   NRA calls for more regulation after Vegas shoo...   \n","17496  Magnitude 5.4 quake rumbles southern Mexico, n...   \n","\n","                                                    text label  \\\n","7878    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump may have ...

His face hidden by a headdress, a man who identified himself as Lushsux said against the backdrop of a cement section of the Israeli wall in Bethlehem that he hoped his painting would draw attention to Palestinians stuck in  an indoor prison . The Bethlehem wall has become a showcase of protest art voicing Palestinians  fears that Israel s West Bank fence-and-concrete barrier is a land grab that may deny them a state. Israelis deem the project a bulwark against Palestinian attack.  The wall is a message in itself,  the man, who said he painted the mural overnight, told Reuters.  I don t need to write  Free Palestine  or something like that, something really direct ... that people will ignore.  I just paint what I usually paint and maybe people will start looking at the background and looking at the razor wire and looking at people stuck in here, and maybe that ll work better,  he said in Australian-accented English. Murals on the barrier believed to be the work of Lushsux include one showing Trump kissing an Israeli watchtower and another depicting him placing his hand on the barrier and thinking about building a similar wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. \",\n          \"TOKYO (Reuters) - Typhoon Lan with heavy rains and destructive winds is expected to hit southern Japan on Sunday when the nation holds a national election, forcing officials in Okinawa to stage voting a day early on some remote islands. The Category 1 typhoon, located east of the Philippines on Friday morning and moving north, is expected to gain strength as it comes some 200 km (125 miles) east of Japan s southern island of Okinawa by Sunday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.  It will likely rain very heavily in the Nansei island chain (in southern Japan), in the Pacific side of western and eastern Japan from the 21st to 23rd. There is a chance it will rain violently in some regions,  the agency said in a statement.          According to the Tropical Storm Risk web site, the typhoon will likely strengthen to category 3, but weaken again by the time it brushes past Tokyo on Monday. Local authorities in Okinawa have decided to move  the voting date to Saturday for some remote islands.             Tomoaki Iwai, political science professor at Nihon University, said the adverse weather is likely to hurt the standing of a new party led by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, the Party of Hope.   Voters with no party affiliation tend not to go and vote (under the bad weather). So, parties that are dependent on the general mood of the voters at a given time, like the Party of Hope, are set to suffer,  Iwai said. He said some supporters of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may opt not to brave the weather and vote as well, believing, based on recent media polls, the ruling party has got the election in the bag. The LDP-led coalition is on track to roughly match the two-thirds  super majority  it held in parliament s lower house before dissolution, helped by divisions in the opposition camp and jitters over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, media forecasts have said.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"TRUE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_processed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21192,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said he had written to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urging bipartisan effort to stabilize the U.S. health insurance market.

It s pretty sickening that she s even being asked to speak at a college commencement ANY college commencement! The Clinton GRIFTERS also owe the Haitian community answers on where money went after the Haiti earthquake relief effort.  The Haitian community is up in arms over much that happened after the 2010 earthquake. This should be interesting:Here is how the Clinton s used the money that Americans donated to help the devastated residents of Haiti to enrich themselves:On June 8, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to serve as the Class of 2017 commencement speaker at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York, where she will also be awarded an honorary degree. The announcement has incited protests from several members of the Haitian community who plan to protest the speech and are pushing the college s president, Rudy Crew, to rescind the invitation.PANDERING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE: Every time the Clintons get in a bind, they run to the black community to whitewash their tarnished image,  said Komokoda, the Haitian group protesting the speech, in a statement.  After Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath in the Monica Lewinsky affair, he brought in Jesse Jackson and a host of black preachers to lead prayers with him at the White House. To divert attention from her  deleted emails  debacle, Hillary had Bill DeBlasio s wife, Chirlane McCray, bring her to Brownsville, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Brooklyn, for a photo op with little black children. When newspaper editorials and cartoons were blasting her for her unending lies and demanding investigations and prosecutions, former New York City mayor David Dinkins brought her out for a keynote speech at his Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University. Today, for her resurrection from a shameful defeat by the last person most reasonable people felt could ever be president of the United States, the dirty work falls to Rudy Crew. HAITI RELIEF SCAM   QUESTIONS REMAIN:The Clintons  role in Haiti has incited immense criticism and has tarnished their relationship with the Haitian community. In 2010, Haiti suffered a massive earthquake. Several NGOs and the United Nations flocked to Haiti to help relief efforts, but their intervention came with several costs. In 2011, UN Peacekeepers caused a massive cholera outbreak that killed at least 9,500 people and sickened 800,000 others. During this time, Bill Clinton served as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While the Clinton Foundation has staunchly defended their role in Haiti, their involvement in the country has been far from successful.  Many of the most notable investments the Clintons helped launch, such as the new Marriott in the capital, have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with,  wrote Jonathan Katz for Politico in 2015.For Komokoda and many Haitians, the Clintons epitomize NGOs and corporations exploiting the crisis and relief efforts in Haiti for their own gain. Haitians also blame the Clintons for the controversial rule of former Haitian President Michel Martelly, who stepped down in February 2016 due to his record of corruption after the Clintons helped him get elected in 2010.MORE ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SCAM ON HAITI:Read more: Observer\",\n          \"Mississippi\\u2019s vast flatlands, laced with the remains of a fading industrial base, are fertile ground for the incendiary populism of Donald Trump. For the insurgent presidential candidate, there\\u2019s plenty of voter outrage to tap into here and in a swathe of other southern states that could push Trump closer to securing the Republican presidential nomination in the coming weeks. Mississippi\\u2019s unemployment rate is among the highest in the nation: more than 75,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared in the past 15 years; and white voters at the core of the state\\u2019s Republican Party fear the rise of immigrant workers. The deep economic dislocation felt by many in Mississippi, reflected in Reuters interviews with dozens of voters, explains how Trump is attracting broad-based support in southern states, including from many evangelical Christian voters prepared to overlook his past liberal positions on touchstone social issues. In South Carolina last weekend, exit polls showed Trump comfortably beat both his closest rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio among evangelical voters, despite their more consistent appeals to Christian values. \\u201cLook at immigration, look at terrorism, look at the things that really matter,\\u201d said Heather Fox, a field director for the Trump campaign in Mississippi. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t have a country, it\\u2019s not going to matter about the Bible or the Constitution because we are going to be dead and gone,\\u201d she added during a recent gathering of Republican voters in a Holiday Inn conference room in Lucedale, southern Mississippi, that began with a prayer.  Caleb Howell, a Baptist deacon, says even those with jobs often see little chance of promotion. \\u201cThere are not many options,\\u201d he said, \\u201ceven for preachers.\\u201d From the Mississippi coast through Alabama, Tennessee and the Appalachian coalfields of Kentucky, America\\u2019s economic recovery has been patchy if not outright elusive. The four-state region is the country\\u2019s least educated and least well paid, according to federal jobs data. Politically, the region has emerged as a bedrock of support for billionaire real estate mogul Trump, who has hammered home his pledge to return America to \\u201cwinning\\u201d ways versus foreign competitors and foes. In polling conducted for Reuters by Ipsos, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky ranked among Trump\\u2019s top seven states nationally, with more than 40 percent of Republicans and independent poll participants backing him. (See this graphic on census data from Trump's heartland. here) Alabama and Tennessee vote on March 1 on \\u201cSuper Tuesday\\u201d, along with 13 other states and territories in the heated race to select the Republican Party\\u2019s presidential candidate. Kentucky holds a Republican caucus on March 5 and Mississippians vote in their party primary on March 8. The 2007 to 2009 economic crisis fell particularly hard on Mississippi and neighboring states. The number of jobs fell faster than in much of the rest of the country, climbed back more slowly, and as of last year remained more than 200,000 short of where it was before the crisis, federal data show. Economic and cultural dislocation runs strong, whether it\\u2019s anger over Washington\\u2019s regulatory reach into industries like coal mining, the perceived threat to conservative values on issues like same-sex marriage, or the conviction that the economy no longer works for average Americans. A nation-leading 32 percent of the adult population in the four-state region has only a high school degree, a problem at a time when the fastest job and wage growth is in occupations that require a bachelor\\u2019s degree or more. Since 2000, jobs available in Mississippi for those with only a high school degree fell five percent, according to a Reuters analysis of federal occupational data. \\u00a0 Between 2000 and 2014, median household income fell nearly 12 percent in Mississippi, about twice as fast as the overall U.S. decline, adjusted for inflation. Income among white households fell slightly more than 12 percent, compared to a decline of less than five percent for all whites nationally. \\u201cWe\\u2019re shipping out all the work and bringing in all the people that don\\u2019t want to work,\\u201d said Walter Wright, 46, who owns a real-estate company in Hurley, Mississippi. He said he supports Trump because of his tough build-a-wall approach to stopping illegal immigration and because \\u201che is angry.\\u201d Although the region has the lowest share of foreign-born residents in the country, at fewer than four percent, and the lowest portion of Hispanic residents, whether born in the U.S. or elsewhere, the numbers have been growing. In Alabama and Mississippi, for instance, the Hispanic population more than doubled from 2000 to 2010. That\\u2019s coincided with a difficult economy. Mississippi, once a major builder of ships and furniture, has seen an exodus of thousands of jobs in both industries to China and Mexico over the past two decades. Mississippi\\u2019s manufacturers shed 75,738 jobs between 2000 and 2015, according to Manufacturers\\u2019 News Inc, a publisher and compiler of industrial directories and databases. \\u201cWe have had way too many industries shut down and now they are in Brazil, they are in Mexico, they are in China,\\u201d said Fox. Trump has said he will bring back American jobs \\u201cfrom China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.\\u201d  He has proposed doing this by slapping tariffs on foreign goods and negotiating better trade deals. He has threatened a 35 percent tax on Ford Motor Corp vehicles made in Mexico that are brought back to the United States to be sold. Most economists doubt Trump can revive manufacturing on its former scale in Mississippi or elsewhere, especially for unskilled workers. His threats also risk a trade war that could backfire by raising costs and hurting American jobs. While trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement may have shifted some jobs abroad, the integration of global supply chains has also helped Tennessee stand out in the region with its booming auto industry, and drawn foreign companies like Airbus to Mobile, Alabama. Republican Party officials say Trump has strong support, especially in northwest Alabama where International Paper Co shut a 43-year-old plant in 2014, laying off 1,100 workers. \\u201cThe day of putting on a suit and tie at 6 in the morning and getting a clean cut shave and taking your briefcase to an office somewhere, it\\u2019s gone,\\u201d said Blake Nash, 29, a Trump supporter whose mother was let go at the plant in 2006. In Nash\\u2019s town of Lexington, near the Tennessee border, red, white and blue Trump signs sprout from streets studded with Baptist churches, the only banners of any presidential candidate in the area.      Nash, who has no health insurance and calls his university degree in health sciences worthless, recently applied for a job with a company that contracts work with Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, but was rejected because he didn\\u2019t have the right training. With good jobs at home scarce, he works on contract in other states such as Texas.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0  Many farmers in Lauderdale County, the location of the International Paper plant, relied on the factory for their primary income, said Charlie Thompson, a farmer who worked there for 34 years and lost his job in 2014. Thompson, 58, former president of the Lauderdale County Farmers Federation, estimates that about 15\\u00a0percent of the sacked workers were farmers, further straining a county where the number of farms was already in decline. \\u201cIf you can equate signs in the yard with being popular, I would say probably Trump is a front runner around here,\\u201d said Thompson. Still, a win is no sure thing.\\u00a0 At the Lucedale forum, Chris McDaniel, a Republican state senator in Mississippi and Cruz supporter, hammered at Trump\\u2019s inconsistency on conservative hot-button issues such as abortion. \\u201cHow sure and solid has Trump been? Just a few years ago, he was pro-choice,\\u201d McDaniel said, referring to a television interview Trump gave in 1999 when he said \\u201cI\\u2019m very pro-choice\\u201d and that he would not ban partial-birth abortions.  He has since said he is against abortion. \\u201cWe are kind of afraid of what he has been in the past,\\u201d said Gussie Vise, 71, a retired teacher and wife of a local preacher. She is leaning toward Cruz but says of Trump,\\u201cwe like him.\\u201d\\u00a0 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["# drop extra column\n","df = df.drop(['text'],axis=1)\n","df[\"label\"] = df.label.apply(lambda  x:0 if x=='TRUE' else 1)\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1221,"status":"ok","timestamp":1716370831654,"user":{"displayName":"syed Noorulhuda","userId":"13441058361303775913"},"user_tz":-300},"id":"HMO_V_vU9ZvE","outputId":"e245b3af-6b3a-4e8d-ad68-2e7a4e5c6359"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       label                                         final_news\n","7878       0  Trump may have stopped the bleeding, but not t...\n","15080      0  Yemen says Saudi-led coalition to allow commer...\n","26491      1   WATCH: Trump Supporter Claims Confederate Fla...\n","41499      1  HOLLYWOOD LIBS Raise Big Money For #CrookedHil...\n","5300       0  Pence, Bannon appeal for conservatives to unit..."],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-d7f5f9d4-abd5-4ab3-b223-b8e6ab56ab50\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","      <th>final_news</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7878</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Trump may have stopped the bleeding, but not t...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>15080</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Yemen says Saudi-led coalition to allow commer...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>26491</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>WATCH: Trump Supporter Claims Confederate Fla...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>41499</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>HOLLYWOOD LIBS Raise Big Money For #CrookedHil...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5300</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Pence, Bannon appeal for conservatives to unit...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-d7f5f9d4-abd5-4ab3-b223-b8e6ab56ab50')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-d7f5f9d4-abd5-4ab3-b223-b8e6ab56ab50 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Merkel, seeking a fourth term in office in Germany s Sept. 24 election, said in a debate on Sunday it was clear that Turkey should not join the European Union, and that she would talk to other EU leaders about ending its stalled accession process.  It is not a coincidence that our president Erdogan was the main topic of the debate,  Erdogan s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted, criticizing what he described as mainstream German politicians   indulgence in populism .  Germany and Europe s attacks on Turkey/Erdogan, by ignoring essential and urgent problems, are reflections of the narrowing of their horizons,  he said.  We hope that the problematic atmosphere that made Turkish-German relations the victim of this narrow political horizon will end . Turkey s ties with Germany and several other EU states have deteriorated sharply this year. Points of dispute have included the barring of Turkish politicians from holding campaign rallies in EU countries ahead of an April referendum, and concerns over the powers granted to Erdogan in the closely fought plebiscite. Turkey has also restricted access for German parliamentarians seeking to visit German troops at the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey, leading Berlin to announce it was moving those forces out of Turkey. It has also detained several German nationals, including journalist Deniz Yucel. Turkey says it has sent Germany an extradition request for one of the main suspects it says was behind an attempted military coup in July 2016. More than 50,000 people have been arrested and 150,000 have been suspended or sacked in a security crackdown since the failed putsch. \",\n          \" Trump Goes On UNHINGED Early Morning Twitter Tirade; Attacks Federal Judge Over Muslim Ban One of Donald Trump s most controversial campaign promises was his  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Now that the power of the presidency is his, Trump tried to do just that last weekend. However, the executive order that enacted the Muslim ban was poorly rolled out, bypassed scrutiny by the agencies charged with enforcing it, and caused protests to erupt nationally and internationally. Further, everyone saw it for what it was: the unconstitutional religious test for entering the United States that Trump had promised on the campaign trail.After a slew of judges struck down parts of the ban, one federal judge, appointed by President George W. Bush, James Robart of Seattle, struck the whole discriminatory policy down. Of course, this didn t sit well with Trump, and he did as he always done with confronted with any sort of criticism or challenge whatsoever, and went on an absolutely crazy Twitter tirade against Judge Robart early Saturday morning. Here are Trump s latest nutty tweets:When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security   big trouble!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Of course, Trump s claims that other countries agree with his ban are patently false. There are protests around the world regarding his bigoted and un-American policies and rhetoric. He has only been in office for two weeks, and has already diminished America s standing in the world greatly by trying to whitewash America and shut out immigrants.Though entirely predictable, Trump s reaction here is highly problematic. He is clearly unraveling at the protests and criticisms against him, and having actual judges rule against him is just too much. What will be really interesting to see is whether or not Trump tries to see how he can remove this judge, just as he did with the Acting Attorney General who said that his Muslim ban was indefensible in court.This man is a literal fascist, America, and we are witnessing his slow destruction of our democracy as we speak. #RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["#combining text_processed and title for creating full news article with headline\n","df['final_news'] = df['title'] + \" \" + df['text_processed']\n","\n","# now we can delete extra columns\n","cols_del =['title','text_processed']\n","df = df.drop(cols_del,axis=1)\n","\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sCNUEqqddgHc"},"source":["IN below code there is lowercase of the data, although it is commonly overlooked, it is one of the most effective techniques when the data is small.

A Western-educated former banker who is fluent in German and English and was sworn in on Monday, Mateusz Morawiecki boasts the credentials needed to negotiate with Brussels. But any compromises to improve relations with Brussels, which sees the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party as a threat to democracy, would risk upsetting the traditional, Catholic supporters who propelled it into power two years ago. It is a gamble that could backfire, and it is not yet clear how far Morawiecki, 49, and his party, dominated by former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are ready to go to please Brussels.   The idea to build up international credibility seems rational,  said Jaroslaw Flis, a sociologist at the Jagiellonian University.
